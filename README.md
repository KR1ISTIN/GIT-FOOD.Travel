# GIT FOOD.Travel

## Description
This site was designed for a traveler looking to find the most luxurious hotels and restaurants in any city they wish to desire. This project allowed us to work as a group in a agile enviroment to practice our communication skills, resolving merge confilcts and practice our coding abilities including: Bulma, JS, JQuery, HTML, CSS, Font Awesome, and incorporating two APIs. As a group we look forward to expanding this project further. 

## Usage

 The traveler will simply enter a city of their choice into the search bar then proceed to add a check in and check out date, click submit. The search will find five random hotels with a rating of 4 stars and above only. The hotels will populate on the left column.

 If the traveler also would like to search for the top restaurants in a city that only include a 4.5 stars and above, the traveler will input the city of their choice into the corosponding search box and press the button "search".
 The fice random restaurants will appear on the right column.
