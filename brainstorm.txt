User Story: As a travler
I want a site that can help me find the top hotels (4.5-5 stars only) and restaurants 4-5stars only
Then I can save them to my favorite list 
So that I can start planning

Acceptance Criteria:
GIVEN when the page loads, the title and description of the site is presented
WHEN the travler is ready to start their search for either a hotel or restaurants, the travler will navigate to one of the search boxes of their choice.
The two search boxes are: hotel and restaurnats
AND when the travler enters a city name in one of the boxes
THEN hotels will pop up below in one column
THEN when traveler searches for restaurants, they will pop up in column two
WHEN the traveler clicks the save button
THEN the favorite will be added to the favorite list found in the navbar
THEN favorites will be added to localStorage

Restaurant API
site for API: https://rapidapi.com/apidojo/api/travel-advisor/
Fetch calls:
 locations/search (Deprecating) : first call: https://travel-advisor.p.rapidapi.com/locations/search?query=san%20antonio&limit=30&offset=0&units=km&location_id=1&currency=USD&sort=relevance&lang=en_US  // this one has to be called first to get the location that the user put it, and then grab the location ID
 restaurants/list (Deprecated):second call: https://travel-advisor.p.rapidapi.com/restaurants/list?location_id=60956&restaurant_tagcategory=10591&restaurant_tagcategory_standalone=10591&currency=USD&lunit=km&limit=30&min_rating=4.5&open_now=false&lang=en_US // this one is need after the first call bc it requires the location ID as a parameter to load the restaurants with a 4.5 rating or more

Hotel API:
site for API: https://rapidapi.com/tipsters/api/priceline-com-provider/
Fetch calls: 
 first call: https://priceline-com-provider.p.rapidapi.com/v1/hotels/locations?name=dallas&search_type=ALL // have to make this call first to get the city ID of whatever the user typed in, SO THEN we can access the hotels in that city
 second call: https://priceline-com-provider.p.rapidapi.com/v1/hotels/search?date_checkout=2023-07-23&sort_order=STAR&date_checkin=2023-07-22&location_id=3000035821&star_rating_ids=4.5,5.0%2C5.0&rooms_number=1 // this link will allow access to the hotels in the city


Overall: 
user needs to be able to search for hotels and restaurants
    A) will need two input boxes
        1) one for hotels
        2) one for restaurants
        3) going to need check in and check out dates
            -get values
            -use template literals
            -get check in and out date value and use them in the fetch url parameter
WHEN the user types in a city THEN clicks the search button
    A) Will need a event listener for food search button- user enters a city
        1)fetch calls will be made
    B) Need to clear the search box after the search button is clicked
    C) hotel search does not need a search button due to fetch call
        1) due to the fetch call parameters, we need to get the value from the city in the hotel input, 
        and combine it in the fetch call with the location ID, and the input values from check in and check wil also be called
        THEN when they hit the submit TEHN the hotels will populate 
LAYOUT for Body:
    A) two columns are needed. 
        1) one for restaurants
        2) one for hotels 
    B) Data will be placed on cards
        1) includes hotel name
        2) includes hotel description 
        1) restaurant name 
        2) restaurant description 
    C) Inside the container create 2 columns
        1) inside each column horizontal cards are needed (maybe 5 on each side)
        2)buttons are on each card so user can press to add to favorite
            - the favorite button will need a event listener 
            -maybe the button will change if clicked 
            -when added to favorites, it also needs to be added to localStoreage
                -localStorage will probably need to use JSON pase and stringify since favorites will need to be added in an array in localStorage

1) user types in city for food
- add cick event on that that search button 
- the value needs to get passed in from search bar 
- the value will then be used to help call the fetch
- so when search button is clicked on food, the fetch needs to be called. 
- refer to line 39 for fetch calls 
- city ID needs to be stored in a variable 
- get location ID and use it for second fetch call
-  second fetch call will get name, and website
- loop through array to access object data: name and url (if name maybe thumbnail photo)
- input to page
- each card needs to equal new Data
2)
- user inputs city for hotel search 
- need to get the value in a variable in search bar
- the value of the input for search, we need to access the location ID
- the location ID will then be used in second fetch call 
- the user also needs to choose a check in and check out date
- get the value of check in and out and set to variable (already done)
- then after retreiving data values from search and check in / our dates
- the fetch call will then run fully on the submit button
- access the name of hotel and website link (maybe thumbnail if possible)
-input data on to page
- store in local storage in object

FOR BOTH:
we will need a for loop through data
Each card.name of hotel or restaurant should have an their own ID
Each card.website or description area of hotel or restaurant should have an their own ID
Add a conditional statement for hotels if no 4.5-5 star hotels are found in that city
